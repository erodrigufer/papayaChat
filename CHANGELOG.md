# Pre-releases
## v0.8.1-beta
* Fix bug, in file_locking.c function handling first messages sent to client failed to send the first line of the chat log
  file.
## v0.8.0-beta
* Fix bug at authentication: if the client provided a false auth key, then the server, would not let it in. But it would also
  not terminate the chield process created to handle the client with the failed authentication. If the sysadmin does not notice
  this, this bug would eventually eat up a lot of resources from the server, if many authentications failed, since a lot of unnecessary
  child process would be running.
## v0.7.1-beta
* Removed one extra newline, by fixing file_locking.c, returning correct value from first messages sent to client
## v0.7.0-beta
* Remove intro message from back-end server, to remove bug of intro message showing up later again
  probably due to a buffer overflow
* First messages sent to client at connection start are now properly controlled to not 
  overflow the chat text window
* [BUG] First messages get two weird newlines after last message
## v0.6.2-beta
* Improve security against leaking key in the client, by memsetting all its values to 0, after finishing using the key.
## v0.6.1-beta
* Update the README section regarding installation of both client and server
## v0.6.0-beta
* Change installation/un-installation API
	- `make install-server`
	- `make install-client`
	- The target `make upgrade` was removed
* Networking workflow updated to show changes changes in Makefile targets
## v0.5.0-beta
* Timeout of 1 second during authentication implemented
## v0.4.0-beta
* Client-server key authentication implemented
* [FEATURE] Implement a timeout on the server-side for the authentication process, otherwise DDoS vulnerable
* This version is a MVP and can be realized as a beta
* [BUG] close file stream on configParser.c
## v0.3.3-alpha
* [FIXED] Fix issue with flags of SIGUSR1 handler, handle would be reset in Linode server
## v0.3.2-alpha
* Front-end now parses PORT and HOST from config file as well
* Server parses PORT from /etc/papayachat/server.config file
* Server availability test automatically parses PORT from ./etc repo files
* A unit test C file for configParser.c is also added to ./tests as test_configParser.c
## v0.3.1-alpha
* [FIXED] client's config file is now handled within the home directory of the user
* The greetings message delivered by the server after establishing a connection now,
  tells the user how to close the chat window.
## v0.3.0-alpha
* A config file parser _library_ was created (configParser.c)
* General config files should be now handled from /etc/
* Both server and client can now dynamically change their behaviour without needing to re-compile by parsing values from config files
* Client parses **USERNAME** from config file
* [TO-DO] Parse PORT, ADDRESS, AUTH_KEY, and so on...
* [BUG] Handle the client's config file from within the home directory, otherwise all users of the client within the same computer would have the
  same username ('_max_mustermann_')
## v0.2.1-alpha
* Major changes on the Makefile UI, it is now possible to install, uninstall, run and upgrade the backend with just simple `make` commands.
## v0.2.0-alpha
* [FIXED] All child processes created in the back-end to handle every single child, properly exit as soon as one of the processes receives EOF from the client.
## v0.1.0-alpha
* [FIXED] Messages are automatically received by a client as soon as another client connects with the server. **This fix still requires more testing!**
* [BUG] Child processes still do not close properly in the server, after a client disconnects from it. `watch ps _u papayachat` to see all processes generated by the clients.
