# Pre-releases
## v0.3.0-alpha
* A config file parser _library_ was created (configParser.c)
* General config files should be now handled from /etc/
* Both server and client can now dynamically change their behaviour without needing to re-compile by parsing values from config files
* Client parsers **USERNAME** from config file
* [TO-DO] Parse PORT, ADDRESS, AUTH_KEY, and so on...
* [BUG] Handle the client's config file from within the home directory, otherwise all users of the client within the same computer would have the
  same username ('_max_mustermann_')
## v0.2.1-alpha
* Major changes on the Makefile UI, it is now possible to install, uninstall, run and upgrade the backend with just simple `make` commands.
## v0.2.0-alpha
* [FIXED] All child processes created in the back-end to handle every single child, properly exit as soon as one of the processes receives EOF from the client.
## v0.1.0-alpha
* [FIXED] Messages are automatically received by a client as soon as another client connects with the server. **This fix still requires more testing!**
* [BUG] Child processes still do not close properly in the server, after a client disconnects from it. Â`watch ps _u papayachat` to see all processes generated by the clients.
