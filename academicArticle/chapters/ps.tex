\section{Problem statement}
As previously stated in the introduction, there is ample literature that affirms that kernel-space context-switching in multi-procedural programs should have a worse CPU-utilization performance than user-space context-switching, but none of the bibliographic sources provide experimental data to corroborate this, show how big the difference is or perform a benchmark for network-related concurrency handling \cite{2003Events}\cite{2005Threads}\cite{2013ContextSwitching}\cite{Cox-Buday2017}\cite{Kerrisk2010}.

This work strives to first design the architecture of a multi-procedural concurrent IM application written in C and, then, create a benchmark that makes a performance comparison with a non-preemptively scheduled IM application in Go possible, to address the following research questions (RQ):

\textbf{RQ 1: How does the mean CPU usage of a multi-procedural C application compares to the CPU usage of a non-preemptively scheduled executable in Go?} As an experimental comparison of the performance of context-switching with a user-space paradigm and a kernel-space one.

\textbf{RQ 2: How stable over a period of time is the CPU usage of the two models being compared?} Is there a difference in the coefficient of variation of both concurrency models? This question is important to more accurately provision servers for high load scenarios.

\textbf{RQ 3: How portable across Unix platforms is the IM application developed in C with minimal dependencies?}

How do two different concurrency approaches like processes and goroutines compare performance-wise (CPU utilization) with a same implementation?
